11. If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some.
12. Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.

13. If two people write exactly the same program, each should be put into microcode and then they certainly won't be the same.
14. In the long run every program becomes rococo - then rubble.
15. Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.
